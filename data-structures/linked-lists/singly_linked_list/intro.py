"""
    In the linked list data structure, items are stored as nodes. 
    Each node in a singly linked list contains data and the reference
    to the next node in the linked list.

    Unlike arrays, linked lists are dynamic data structures(no resize
    operation is required). In addition to that, manipulating the first item in a
    linked list is quite efficient O(1).

    However, linked lists don't do  so well when it comes to manipulating the
    last item or items at arbitrary locations. All the mentioned ops in this
    paragraph have an O(n) runtime complexity.
