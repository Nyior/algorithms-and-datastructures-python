    A stack is essentially an Abstract data type.
    (it is built on top of/ it is a super type of some datastructure: lists and linked-lists).
    It is an ADT because it defines the operations that could be performed
    on the datastructure without specifying the underlying data arrangement
    at the momory level.

    It is a Last In First Out(LIFO) data structure that allows access to the
    data structure from just one open end through which elements could
    be added(push), removed(pop) and retrieved(peek).
