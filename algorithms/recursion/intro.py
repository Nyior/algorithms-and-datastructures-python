one area in which recursion shines is where we need to act on a problem 
that has an arbitrary number of levels of depth. 
A second area in which recursion shines is where
it is able to make a calculation based on a subproblem of the problem at hand.

steps to solving a recursive problem with sub-problems

1. Imagine the function youâ€™re writing has already been implemented by
someone else.
2. Identify the subproblem of the problem.
3. See what happens when you call the function on the subproblem and go
from there.
