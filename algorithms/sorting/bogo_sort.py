"""
    This sorting algorithm keeps generating all the possible permutations
    of the list it is passed until it finds the sorted version of that list.

    it has a running time complexity of O(n!). It is the most inefficient
    sorting algorithm. But when executed on a quantum computer, it has one of the 
    run time.
